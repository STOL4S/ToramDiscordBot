**Skill Effect:**
If you use the attack cast while you have no charges, it will fizzle (and your avatar will look puzzled)
 This skill will add an additional hit if a decoy from Decoy Shot is active
If the attack cast has the same Combo Tag as the buff cast did, the Combo Tag of the attack cast will be ignored
The Combo Multiplier carries over from the buff cast; this takes into account if the attack cast's Combo Tag is ignored; the total Combo **Multiplier is calculated as follows:**
CrossFire Total Combo Multiplier = Attack Cast Combo Multiplier + Buff Cast Combo Multiplier - 100
- Remember! Out of all combo tags, Only Bloodsucker(lifesteal) and Mindâ€™s eye(always graze/no miss) tags cannot apply on buff(Charge) cast, but Bloodsucker after-effect(Spirit = boost dmg), Smite, Save and the rest can apply on buff cast.
